# The Impact of a Professional Athlete on a Local (County's) Economy

## Megan Moroney, Mike Gleixner, Rick Gentile, Zachary Frame

### Project Description: 

 What if we told you one person can have an impact on a city’s economy? Utilizing data from sources such as the Small Business Administration, Bureau of Labor and Statistics and Basketball Reference along with zip code data we will determine the impact of LeBron James’ tenure in Cleveland for two separate time frames and what happened when he took his talents to South Beach. By reviewing retail, hotel and restaurant data his importance to the local economy will be shown as destination during the NBA regular season and post-season calendar of October to June each year.
 
## Research Questions to Answer:
### What was the economic impact to the City of Cleveland during the following years:

           2003-2010 – LeBron James in Cleveland with a trip to the NBA Finals in 2007
           2010-2014 – LeBron James in Miami.
           2014-2018 – LeBron James back home with four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and an NBA Championship in 2016.
           
### What was the impact of LeBron James playing in Cleveland on restaurants, retail sales, hotels and game attendance?
### How do other events such as the Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Browns and concerts affect the data?

By deciding to leave for a clearer path to a championship, then returning four years later what was the economic impact of LeBron James wearing a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform for the city of Cleveland?

           What was the impact to Miami when he played for the Heat?
